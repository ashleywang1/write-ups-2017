## Write-up

For those with absolutely no idea what a SQL injection is, here is a wonderful tutorial: https://www.hacksplaining.com/exercises/sql-injection.

Otherwise, whenever you see a SQL injection, always try the following:

* ' or 1=1
* ' or 1=1 --

In this case, trying the first one resulted in an error of
> select * from users where user = '' and pass = '' or 1=1';

This was a pretty big hint. The two dashes '--' just tell the SQL statement to ignore the rest of the code, which neatly solves the problem of the last single quote.
